UIC - The Unified Installation Creator
======================================

**uic** is a toolkit build on top of `debootstrap` that allows to automate the
creation of customized command line Linux installations based on Debian-Derived
distributions. It is able to create life distributions as well as install a
customized distribution on a target system. It is mainly intended as a toolkit
for system administrators who have often to install Linux servers with
particular, repeating characteristics.

Since __uic__ is still under heavy development and in the design phase, there
is no documentation available except of the included man pages and some real
life projects ([Netpoldo Rescue System](https://github.com/YeaSoft/netpoldo)
and [Alix Rescue](https://github.com/YeaSoft/netpoldo/alix-rescue) )

More documentation will follow as soon as some internal workflows have
consolidated.
