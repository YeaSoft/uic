Release Scope
-------------
This release fixes an error that is potentially very dangerous because it
may compromise the host system, but at now not really harmful, since the
affected feature was not used in any avaiable uic template.
Additionally it adds two new commands that are very useful when using
uic for installing new machines. This will in particular support the first
templates for Alix Boards.


What's new
----------
  * Critical: Fixed a serious bug (missing chroot) in processing
    file remove lists during the customization phase. This bug could 
    in certain cases compromise the host system.
  * Added new commands uic_attach and uic_detach
  * Updated version numbers and release numbers in man pages

Known Problems
--------------

 * The command uic_update is still not implemented
 * During the execution of uic_create and uic_upgrade it still happens that
   some process is started in the chroot preventing the special filesystems to
   be unmounted. This happens currently with NetPoldo 10.04 and is fixed by
   a workaround stopping all possibly afected services in the hook script
   'chroot_post_installation'
