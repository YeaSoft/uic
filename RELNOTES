Release Scope
-------------
This release continues the implementation of features inspired by the creation
of templates for Alix boards started in the previous release. Since under
certian aspects Debian may be more suitable for operating small appliances, it
is now time to test and adapt uic also to Debian based installations.
In addition to supporting Debian for the first time, this release offers also
some additional features needed as side effect of the debian compatibility.


What's new
----------
  * Feature: Added support for Debian squeeze
  * Feature: Added support for installing bundled .deb packages
  * Feature: New build step "report" creates an installation report
  * Feature: New build step "archive" produces an archive of the root
    filesystem
  * Fix: binary package architecture set to "all"
  * Fix: remove debris (/run/shm on /run/shm) in mount table after
    operations requiring special fs mounts
  * Fix: reconfigure steps are not mandatory any more (UIC_RECONFIGURE
    can be left empty)
  * Fix: locales are regenerated also on uic_upgrade


Known Problems
--------------

 * The command uic_update is still not implemented
 * During the execution of uic_create and uic_upgrade it still happens that
   some process is started in the chroot preventing the special filesystems to
   be unmounted. This happens currently with NetPoldo 10.04 and is fixed by
   a workaround stopping all possibly afected services in the hook script
   'chroot_post_installation'
