Release Scope
-------------

By implementing the possibility to seamlessly add any package repository into
an installation, uic has released the last dependency from Ubuntu making it
possible to create installations for any debian based distribution. This
makes is possible to replace lots of customisations in existing templates
with packages making it possible to keep them up to date.
Also the compatibility between build system and taget system is now checked
against the effective capabilities of the system.
After two years of internal use, the project is now getting more mature and
therefore the sources are now maintained on GitHub.


What's new
----------

  * Feature: Add support for installing trusted keys for external
    repositories from the /install directory (Closes #2)
  * Feature: release compatibility is now tested towards the
    distributions supported by debootstrap (Closes #3)
  * Feature: New commands for direct installation/purge of
    packages (Closes #4)
  * Feature: Added -e option to uic_get to enter directly
    the installation area (Closes #5)
  * Feature: Added template compatibility check (Closes #6)
  * Fix: improved APT proxy handling
  * Fix: debootstrap errors are now detected and cause uic_create
    to stop further processing (Closes 8)

Known Problems
--------------

 * During the execution of uic_create and uic_upgrade it may still happen that
   some process is started in the chroot preventing the special filesystems to
   be unmounted. This happens sometime with NetPoldo 10.04 and is fixed by a
   workaround stopping all possibly affected services in the hook script
   'chroot_post_installation'
