Release Scope
-------------
This release is primarily inspired by the creation of templates for Alix
boards. In order to provide a valid installation toolset a NetPoldo-like
basic boot system for Alix is required. From this system it should be possible
to install an Alix-System using uic. In order to achive that, two important
features have been added: PPA support in order to include uic itself in a
uic generated system and the possibility to attach a partition or directory
to the uic creation environment.


What's new
----------
  * Critical Fix: Fixed a serious bug (missing chroot) in processing
    file remove lists during the customization phase. This bug could 
    in certain cases compromise the host system.
  * Added support for launchpad PPA through UIC_PPAS in uictpl.conf
  * Added new commands uic_attach and uic_detach
  * Updated version numbers and release numbers in man pages


Known Problems
--------------

 * The command uic_update is still not implemented
 * During the execution of uic_create and uic_upgrade it still happens that
   some process is started in the chroot preventing the special filesystems to
   be unmounted. This happens currently with NetPoldo 10.04 and is fixed by
   a workaround stopping all possibly afected services in the hook script
   'chroot_post_installation'
