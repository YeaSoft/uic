uic (0.13) lucid; urgency=low

  * Fix: uic pack now creates a clean .md5 file without any path component
  * Fix: uic create and uic upgrade should not ask any more for user input
    when trying to overwrite modified configuration files from the uic template
  * Fix: file customizations are re-applied at the end of uic create and uic
    upgrade since sometimes package update or installation overwrite files
    without asking
  * Fix: verbosity of apt is now dependant upon the uic verbosity level
  * Fix: compatibility checking prevents running uic on unsupported platforms
    or with templates with targets not compatible with the hosting system
